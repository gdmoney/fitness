**Recap**: good year even though I hit only 5 goals out of 12. Not having any notable injuries was great as I was able to do all the movements throughout the year. **Highlights:** BB OHP 175 for 11 reps followed by BB bench press 225 for 15 reps. **Misses:** too many missed workouts. While working out every single day is not realistic due to illness, I shouldn't miss any days for any other reason. **Plans for next year:** stick with the current program as it seems to be working. Keep focusing on building a strong foundation with higher rep sets and clean form. Maintain current strength levels while losing weight. **Yearly totals:** 211 resistance plus cardio days, 131 cardio only days, 23 missed days.
